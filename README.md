# BitmapFig2MatlabFig
MATLAB script to extract x,y data from bitmap figures (messy code of personal use)

This MATLAB code is intended to extract data points (x,y) from bitmap figures/images to create new vector figures in MATLAB format (or CSV files). The code is a personal tool developed by myself intended for personal use due to a specific need, so that the code is quite messy and commented in Portuguese. It is available hopefully to be useful, and I will eventually update it to a less messy version and with English comments (but it may take a long time to happen, so it is available "as is" for now).
